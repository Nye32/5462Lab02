PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
___________________

The goal of this progam is to utilize a TCP Connection
in order to send any file from a client to a server.

The file sent by the client will be located in the "recvd" subdirectory in the server/host location.

	| ftps.c

The ftps.c file contains the code for the server. The server
is responsible for creating a socket and listening for a
client to connect. Upon connection the server will expect
the first 24 bytes recieved to contain the filesize and
filename of the file to be transferred. The server will then
read from the stream the appropriate number of bytes as
described by the filesize in chunks of 1000. The fill will be
stored in a newly created subdirectory "recvd".

	| ftpc.c

The ftpc.c file containst he code for the client. The client
is responsible for establishing a socket connection with the
server using the server's ip and port numbers. The client
must also have access to the file that is to be transferred.
As described below, these are all parameters to be used when
running ftpc. The client determines the filesize and filename
and sends them to the server as the first 24 bytes. The client
then sends the bytes of the file until the entire file has
been sent.

Running Instruction
___________________

To run this program you will first run the server using the
following command.
	|ftps <local-port>

Once the server is running it will let you know by saying:
	|'TCP Server Initialized. Awaiting Clients...'

Then on on a seperate terminal/machine run the client by
using the following command.
	| ftpc <remote-IP> <remote-port> <local-file-to-transfer>
